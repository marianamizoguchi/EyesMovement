# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes

**Description:** This project applies skills in JavaScript, CSS and the DOM manipulation to create a dynamic experience, as the mouse movement event in JavaScript is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. We created a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement.

**How to run:** Just launch the website and run the mouse around. You will see the eyes following the move.
