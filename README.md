# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>
**Description:** This project applies skills in JavaScript and CSS to create a dynamic experience, as the mouse movement event in JavaScript is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. We created a web page with two eyes that follow your mouse movement.

**How to run:** Just launch the website and run the mouse around. You will see the eyes following the move.

**Roadmap:** Future interesting improvements for users would be to have the estimated time for the next bus to arrive at a specific bus stop. The roadmap for this improvement is still TBD.
